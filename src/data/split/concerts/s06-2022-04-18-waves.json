  "description": "To cap off the return of live audiences and end our 6th season, enSRQ premieres a final co-commission, WAVES, by Sebastian Currier. Based on the eponymous book by Virginia Woolf, this work for soprano, small ensemble and electronics, enters the thoughts of various women and girls, from a young child to an eighty year old woman, ultimately representing just one woman's conscious life, not unfolding over decades, but coexisting within a single day. WAVES is paired with Anna Thorvaldsdottir's Entropic Arrows and firn, the second work of our season exploration of Yaz Lancaster's music.",
